. Layout (activity_main.xml):
        Added a TextView (sensorDataBox) to display the accelerometer and gyroscope data.
        Placed three buttons (CALL CAREGIVER, CALL EMERGENCY, SETUP) vertically below the sensor data box.

. MainActivity.java:

        Implemented SensorEventListener to listen for accelerometer and gyroscope data.
        Registered the sensors in onCreate and updated the sensorDataBox with real-time sensor data in the onSensorChanged method.
        Implemented the button click listeners to handle navigation and future functionalities.
